freelancehours - My personal hour tracker
===========================================

This is a small Google App Engine app for tracking my hours in different
projects. The basic idea is to have a simple list of different tasks 
with buttons to start and stop them. It also includes the ability to add
new projects and track them separately.

It is currently in a very alpha release and it's here for my personal
tracking. But of course I would be glad if someone wants to use it and
improve on it.
